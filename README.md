# odin-recipes
The project is to create a simple recipe website. The aim is to put into practice the HTML skills learned so far.
If successful, I will have demonstrated my ability to use simple formatting like emphasis, strong, paragraphs and lists. I will also be able to link between webpages and include images within my webpages.
The project should also allow me to practice writing good commit messages and publish my project via github.
